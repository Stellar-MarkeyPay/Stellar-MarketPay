## Testing

### Frontend snapshot tests

Component snapshots live under `frontend/__tests__/` and cover `JobCard`, `JobCardSkeleton`, `RatingForm`, `Toast`, `FreelancerTierBadge`, and `Navbar`.

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

When you intentionally change UI markup, regenerate snapshots:

```bash
npm run test:update-snapshots
```

CI runs `npm test` without `-u`, so outdated snapshots fail the build.

### Backend coverage

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

Coverage HTML is written to `backend/coverage/`. Thresholds are enforced in `backend/package.json` (minimum 60% lines, 50% branches on covered middleware and service modules). The full suite in `src/services/*.test.js` still runs on every `npm test`.

### End-to-end tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e
```

`tests/e2e/full-marketplace-flow.spec.ts` exercises the full client and freelancer journey with two mock Freighter accounts and `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_CONTRACT_MOCK=true` (no testnet required).

### Smart contract deployment

See [docs/contract-deployment.md](docs/contract-deployment.md) for Soroban build, deploy, and env configuration steps.
