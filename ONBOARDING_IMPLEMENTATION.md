- Allows users to review onboarding anytime

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

- **useOnboarding Hook**: Centralized state management
  - Fetches user profile
  - Calculates completion progress
  - Manages localStorage persistence
  - Provides helper functions for state updates

### Storage Strategy

```typescript
// localStorage keys
marketpay_onboarding_completed: {
  hasSeenWelcome: boolean;
  checklistDismissed: boolean;
}
marketpay_tooltips_dismissed: string[] // Array of tooltip IDs
```

### Progress Calculation

```typescript
{
  hasAvatar: displayName?.length >= 3,
  hasBio: bio?.length >= 10,
  hasSkills: skills?.length > 0,
  hasPortfolio: portfolioItems?.length > 0 || portfolioFiles?.length > 0,
  completionPercentage: (completed / 4) * 100,
  isComplete: completed === 4
}
```

### Styling & Animations

- **Onboarding Highlight**: Pulse animation for tooltip targets
- **Fade In**: Smooth entrance for modals and tooltips
- **Scale In**: Modal entrance animation
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Consistent with platform design
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

## User Flow

### First-Time User Journey

1. User logs in for the first time
2. **Welcome Modal** appears with platform introduction
3. User clicks "Get Started" → navigates to profile edit
4. **Profile Checklist** appears on dashboard
5. User completes profile items (name, bio, skills, portfolio)
6. **Tooltips** guide user to key actions
7. Progress bar updates as items are completed
8. **Profile Complete Badge** shows when done
9. Checklist automatically hides

### Returning User

- No welcome modal (already seen)
- Checklist shows if profile incomplete
- Tooltips show if not dismissed
- Can restart onboarding from settings

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **First Login Flow**
   - Clear localStorage
   - Login with new wallet
   - Verify welcome modal appears
   - Click "Get Started" → should navigate to profile edit

2. **Profile Completion**
   - Add display name → checklist updates
   - Add bio → checklist updates
   - Add skills → checklist updates
   - Add portfolio → checklist updates
   - Verify progress bar shows 100%
   - Verify complete badge appears

3. **Tooltips**
   - Verify tooltips appear for new users
   - Click target elements → tooltips should highlight
   - Dismiss individual tooltip → should not reappear
   - Dismiss all → all tooltips should disappear

4. **Restart Onboarding**
   - Go to Security tab
   - Click "Restart Onboarding Tour"
   - Verify page reloads
   - Verify welcome modal appears again

5. **Persistence**
   - Complete onboarding
   - Refresh page → should not show welcome/checklist
   - Clear localStorage → should show onboarding again

### Edge Cases

- User dismisses checklist before completion
- User completes profile items in different order
- User navigates away during onboarding
- Multiple browser tabs open
- Mobile vs desktop experience

## Code Quality

### TypeScript

- ✅ All components fully typed
- ✅ No `any` types used
- ✅ Proper interface definitions
- ✅ Type-safe localStorage operations

### Accessibility

- ✅ Modal traps focus
- ✅ Keyboard navigation supported
- ✅ ARIA labels for progress indicators
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure

### Performance

- ✅ Memoized calculations with `useMemo`
- ✅ Efficient re-renders
- ✅ Lazy loading of profile data
- ✅ Minimal localStorage operations

### Code Organization

- ✅ Modular component structure
- ✅ Reusable hook pattern
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## Known Limitations

1. **Existing Errors**: The codebase has pre-existing TypeScript errors in:
   - `lib/stellar.ts` (2 errors)
   - `pages/jobs/[id].tsx` (45 errors)

   These are **not related** to the onboarding implementation and existed before this feature was added.

2. **Avatar Upload**: Currently tracks display name instead of actual avatar upload (no avatar upload feature exists yet)

3. **Backend Integration**: Onboarding state is stored in localStorage only. Consider adding backend persistence for cross-device sync in the future.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Persistence**
   - Store onboarding state in database
   - Sync across devices
   - Track analytics (completion rates, drop-off points)

2. **Advanced Tooltips**
   - Step-by-step guided tour
   - Interactive tutorials
   - Video walkthroughs

3. **Gamification**
   - Badges for completing onboarding
   - Rewards for profile completion
   - Leaderboard for early adopters

4. **A/B Testing**
   - Test different welcome messages
   - Optimize checklist order
   - Measure conversion rates

5. **Personalization**
   - Role-based onboarding (client vs freelancer)
   - Skill-specific guidance
   - Customized tooltips based on user behavior
