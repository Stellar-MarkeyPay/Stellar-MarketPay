# Getting Started

Welcome to Stellar MarketPay 👋  
This guide will walk you through setting up the project locally and completing a full workflow; from funding your wallet to posting and completing a job.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Git**
- A modern browser (Chrome recommended)

### Install Freighter Wallet

Freighter is required to interact with the Stellar blockchain.

1. Visit: https://freighter.app/
2. Install the browser extension
3. Create a new wallet or import an existing one
4. Safely store your secret key

### Switch to Testnet

1. Open Freighter
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Change network from **Public** → **Testnet**

> ⚠️ This project uses Stellar Testnet. Transactions will not work on Public network.

---

## 2. Running the App Locally

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emmy123222/Stellar-MarketPay-.git
cd Stellar-MarketPay-
```

### Setup Development Environment

If the project includes a setup script:

```bash
chmod +x setup-dev.sh
./setup-dev.sh
```

If not, install dependencies manually:

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install

# Backend
cd ../backend
```

### Start the Application

For a clean local setup, start the shared dependencies in Docker and then run the app locally:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

Open two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://stellarwork:stellarwork_dev@localhost:5432/stellarwork \
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 \
npm run dev
```

```bash
# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000 \
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_CONTRACT_MOCK=true \
npm run dev
```

Access the App

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:4000
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
- Redis: localhost:6379

If you prefer the full Compose stack, run `docker compose up --build` instead.
